 civic_cbshing_nuclear_vault:0 "Nuclear Vault"
 civic_cbshing_nuclear_vault_desc:0 "Protected by a large underground vault, this society was spared the horrors of nuclear war. Cramped together they succeed to preserve their society, but they were unprepared for the harsh reality of surface life."
 civic_tooltip_oc_nuclear_vault_effects:1 "$MOD_POP_HOUSING_USAGE_MULT$: §G-10%§!\nCapital starts as a §Y$pc_nuked$§! with a unique §Y$d_oc_vault_complex$§! deposit, which gives several §Yresearch§! and §Yamenities§! bonuses to the capital planet."

 civic_cbshing_voidborne_desc:0 "This society has long lived in the void of space. Prolonged low gravity living has made it impossible for them to live on any planet."

 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_NUCLEAR_MUTATION:0 "In the eons since the first primitive [GetSpeciesName] communities took shape on the great wasteland of [GetHomeWorldName], our civilization spread and prospered."
 START_SCREEN_PART_ONE_VOIDBORNE:0 "Eons ago the first primitive [GetSpeciesNamePlural] escaped our doomed home of [GetHomeWorldName], building a civilization that lived in the void."
 
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_CLIMATE_SHIFT:0 "As our scientific knowledge increased so did our understanding of our environment and the realization that the climate of our world was changing.  This profound knowledge unified the various nation states with a common goal: to ensure the survival of our species in our harsh new world."
 START_SCREEN_PART_TWO_NUCLEAR_VAULT:0 "The early period of our history where many nation states vied for power culminated in a great tragedy during our atomic age. The detonation of hundreds of nuclear warheads left our world in ruins. If not for the great underground vaults and the leaders who lead them, our species would not have been able to survive and rebuild our world to what it is today."
