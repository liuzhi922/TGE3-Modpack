 alpha_gate.3.name:0 "Discovering Alpha-Gate"
 alpha_gate.3.desc:0 "As our ships enter the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system, sensors pick up a strange yet familiar energy signature. What was first thought to be a L-Gate is revealed to be a similar but vastly older structure. As if someone had taken these gateways as inspiration for the L-Gates. But unlike the L-Gates this gateway seems to be out of liquid metal, running through a crystaline structure. Many crystals are shattered and some of the liquid metal floats around the structure."
 alpha_gate.3.b.desc:0 "As our ships enter the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system, sensors pick up a strange yet familiar energy signature. What was first thought to be a normnal Gateway is revealed to be a similar but vastly older structure. As if someone had taken these gateways as inspiration. But unlike the Gateways we know this gateway seems to be out of liquid metal, running through a crystaline structure. Many crystals are shattered and some of the liquid metal floats around the structure."
 alpha_gate.3.c.desc:0 "As our ships enter the §H[From.solar_system.GetName]§! system, sensors pick up a strange yet familiar energy signature. What was first thought to be an L-Gate is revealed to be a similar but vastly older structure. As if someone had taken these gateways as inspiration for the later L-Gates and normal Gateways. But unlike the L-Gates this gateway seems to be completely out of liquid metal, running through a crystaline structure. Many crystals are shattered and some of the liquid metal floats around the structure."

 alpha_gate.7.name:0 "Alpha Gate Overload"
 alpha_gate.7.desc:0 "Our scientists tried to overload the crystaline structure by sending in energy through the broken parts. But as soon as the energy transfer was complete the liquid metal that was floating idlely around the structure closed all holes and is remaining in place. All energy output vanished afterwards. Our scientist gave up on researching it any further."
 alpha_gate.8.name:0 "Alpha Gate Restoration"
 alpha_gate.8.desc:0 "The liquid metal floating around the structure is actively hindering the process of repairing the Alpha Gate. Every attempt from our Engineering Staff failed to lay hand on the crystaline structure. But from the movement of the metal, we could learn new things for our metallic research department."

 alpha_gate.10.desc:0 "Our scientists on [Root.Capital.GetName] pick up a ongoing subspace transmission, but they are unable to track down the location. Strangely enough all Alpha Gates we encountered started to repair themselves. The liquid metal around the structures flew into the openings and the crystals are regrowing. Our scientists estimate it will take some years but after that the Alpha Gate should be restored."
 alpha_gate.10a.desc:0 "Our scientists on [Root.Capital.GetName] pick up a ongoing subspace transmission, but they are unable to track down the location nor its purpose."
 alpha_gate.12.name:0 "Alpha Gate Activation"
 alpha_gate.12.desc:0 "The Alpha Gates finsihed their repair. As soon as the last hole closed the liquid metal started to flow faster and faster inside the crystaline strcuture and a Gate opened into a far undiscovered sector."
